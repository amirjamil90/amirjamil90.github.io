                <p>
                    It has been 4 months since I have thought about Future. Its only today that I am writing about the state of my mind. I am Free today for next 4 hours so I have enough time , although plugged in with mashups of last year is reducing my efficieny in collecting stuffs to write.
                    The work pressure has been comparitively less relative to Last Year. Although TCIL is trying to diversify the work in IT Field for ecommerce but not a major success till now. Only Prototype Meetings are going on. Since Last 4 months, I am reading more and more books to increase my perception level of things around me. Not only Technical Stuffs but more inclined towards Philosphy of Life.

                    Well, One of the major Pros of Govermnent Job is that we get time to think of what kind of life we are living ..What are the changes 
                    which are going on in the world ... From Economics to Social, Political to Climatic . One would also get time for hobbies like me right now..Plugged in and writing boring stuffs for barely nobody but for myself. There are so many writers around the World who try to potrait a 
                    picture of Life. But I wonder sometimes.. Do they really write for themselves ???? Time to Think !!! ...................Or it's just a stress on their mind for thinking in different way. Whether its Paulo Cohelo or Paula Hawkins, at some point of time I think they are just same.. But its my perception for them .... 

                    Well I am not in comparison mode for the writers but to where to take myself in future.

                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> "Coding" isn't the Word where "Life" could set in </i> </h2>                
                <p>
                Even Though I spend my free time more on github, digit, and automating my work, I believe its not the way to live life...
                It is only 8 years since I am coding but<i> "Life won't run on Code"</i>. All technologies get saturated at certain point of time.... Same will be the fate for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning which have gained popularity in recent years.. As Elon Musk Pointed Out ... <i>"Artificial Intelligence will have drastic impact on our life"</i> . The more  Mechatronic World becomes ... More diseases will be invited.. Although u will have better technologies for tackling them but as the saying goes <i>"Prevention is better than Cure "</i> I have been realizing this fact that children in this century are finding <i>"Tabs"</i> more fascinated than Cycling and Playing Outdoor Games. These children dont get a broader mindset for percieving things... Interaction with Nature is not the part of education today.. Rather, Computers are being taught from Class-1 ...Virtual Reality is taking over Nature Gifts ....
                </p>
                <p>
                Its been 3 hours since I am collecting and writing Stuffs. All the Mashups have been Completed and Going to rest ... 
                Miles to go before I sleep....
