                <p>
                     I am writing just to take things off my mind. How does it feels to be away from home ...?, Specially during festival time ...
                     It is the last eve of long boring holiday of 5 days.. 
                     Although I started my Eid preparations 15 days ago ..., but not for me ..for my family in India.
                 </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 19th August,2017</i> </h2>
                <p>
                    After completing my work in the office, I thought to give my mother some gifts for Eid-Ul-Adha .. Since I am not able to call her here due to some official delay.. I thought of delivering some clothes from very common e-commerce site Flipkart.. 
                    Therefore, I gave a random search at first and then decided to send some of them via flipkart...
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 24th August,2017 </i> </h2>                
                <p>
                    I sent some money to my brother to make a sacrifice this Eid-Ul-Adha. Also I planned to go U.A.E for visit during Eid Holidays..
                    But owing to work pressure on my roommates(not me .. )we had to cancel the plan on 27th August... 
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 29th August,2017 </i> </h2>                
                 <p>
                   Now,from here the boring state of life starts... Holidays going to start ..and nothing as such to be done during these days.
                   Although there are times when some people like loneliness.. I am not one of those... Specially in festival times...
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 31st August,2017 </i> </h2>                
                <p>
                    All my gifts were recieved by my mother.. She was extremely happy and gave me lots of dua.
                    It was Chand Raat  here... A very beautiful eve in Lucknow but here I just see cars running by ... 
                    At first, I thought of purchasing some new clothes for myself also .. but in the second thought changed my mind ...
                    Who is here to see me ?? 
                    And I slept early ...
                    My vacations had also started..
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 1st September,2017 </i> </h2>                
                <p>
                    Unlike the Indian time, Eid prayer in Saudi Arabia is at 5:34 am .. Thats a bit early but I think its the right time.
                    Fearing that I may not able to attend the prayers(Shaitaan wandering over me), I got up at 4:00 clock and after getting ready went straight to mosque.

                    Eid prayers were completed and since there was not much to do.. I slept again..I didnt call home that day. Feeling is just unexplainable..
                     I got up around 11am for Juma Prayers and went for Salah.. 
                     After taking the Lunch I came home , opened my laptop..did some boring programming stuffs(creating autohot key for my new laptop).
                     Neverthless.... I slept again and woke for Magrib Salah. 
                     All this time I just thought about going home...
                     With two of my friends went to Khana Khazana(the best Indian Cusine restaurant)..making sure to have biryani for dinner.
                 </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 2nd September,2017 </i> </h2>                
                 <p>
                    I woke up at around 9am(early than the rest of holiday days)
                    Called My mother and other family members. 
                    Sent Eid messages in Whats App . 
                    And slept again...How hard it is to resist not being at home while everyone else is present....
                </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><i> 3rd September,2017 </i> </h2>                
                <p>
                    the next days went in movies and tv series ... My only companion here excluding the IELTS book, and 3 novels which I have not completed till now owing to time ....
                </p>
                <p>
                    There isnt much to say now.. Only one thing... ITs hard to live abroad... You wil have money with u  ... but u won't be able to spend them... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is life .. where only few in hundreds will know ur name .. Perhaps the number of people knowing u(not just ur name) is very
                    less... Maybe in single digits. Someone rightly said, "His facebook account has 910 friends, instagram has 600,.... Only 15 people outside the hospital when he was ill". So, if u look at the word "Facebook"... It itself depicts @false show up@ pretending that u are doing good by liking good pictures and status...sharing misery of poor people and other stuffs.. I am not in a mood to say that all have false advertising but maximum do have.. It is just creating a virtual world before us... not believing in the real world and its purpose... 
                </p>
                <P>
                    If we really want to do something .. we need to save the poors from dying .. Many Indians are posting the Killings of people across the world .. But very few pay attentions to killings in their own country ... Bihar Floods are least covered in News while Mumbai rains is TRP generation factor for media. Help people in Bihar,Help poors in Mumbai,Help people across the world who needs u.. 
                    Be with some organisation which educate the poor people..  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Living here in Riyadh , I get time to actually think about these stuffs.. I have associated myself with an organisation "Bihar Anjum" which is educating the poor people in Bihar. It feels good ..Although I am not able to pay the fees of any child at present but Insha Allah next year i will take sponsor for one child. May Allah give me strength to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now many of the readers will be thinking that I am just telling my good deeds... If I post a photo of myself thats good but If i post something that may chnage the mind of one people .. that is excellent and thats the reason I decide to tell some good deeds.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Miles to go before i sleep..
                </p>
