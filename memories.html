                <p> I am Mohammad Amir Jamil,A bored government official who is spending lonely life in Kingdom
                    of Saudi Arabia. I like to write stuffs of what I have done so far and want I to do in near Future.
                    But this blog is different one.. Its about a friend who is very special to me(even though I may not be special to her... Yes its "Her"). This blog is just a demonstration of <i>"what a relation between a boy and a girl can be like"</i>.It has been 19 years since I have know her but dont go on years.. our bond is centuries old !!!! HAHAAHHAAHA!!!.
                    Without making more delay lets get to the beginning...  
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Shifting of House ..... A mere coincidence to be neighbours</i> </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was not aware of the impact of our friendship, otherwise I would have written the exact dates but it was a very good choice of my beloved father to shift the house near to her. It was then we became friends .. although we didnt new what "friend" meant at that time . But we knew 1 thing "Playing around", "talking","cycling","hide and seek","mario" and other stuffs. It was just like she was my shadow.We would always be found together...wherever.. 
                    And as the saying goes "If u want to find her, find amir"... It may be vice versa also but since I am the writer I have advantage of moulding certain situations. 
                    Only 2 big hats came in our birthdays. One for me and one for her.(Rest all had small caps ... laugh out).
                    I always thank Allah that Mobile was not a common thing that time. So we had stufs like videogame, cycling(although I didn't have). Well This is end to our kids life as neighbours ..Did our friendship change ???
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i>10-A Kamla Nehru Nagar</i></h2>                
                <p>

                    It was then I shifted to new place.I dont remember the exact feelings when we left but our friendship changed ....
                    From daily meetings it just went to meet in some marriges/birthdays/Nani's House etc. But whenever we met Half our time was spent in shying as to who starts the talk first. But once we started talking then thoughts of Einstein can go that much as to how deep were our talks could have gone. We talked about games/drawing(her drawing was very good). At present, I dont know how her drawing is?? but still I know she won't change in future(I may change for the world but not for her).
                    Our childhood was getting hunged up with tensions of studies.But did we parted from frienship......... ??
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Summer Vacations</i></h2>                 
                <p>
                    Summer vacations were just wonderful. We met in Nani's house in Chowk where we use to play all day long. I want to mention here about my favourite uncle "Guddu Mamu" who was just awesome with us. He was the one who took some pictures of our childhood.I never got the glimpse of those photos and do ask him sometimes to show those but he never does.... 
                    We went to parks, palyed carrom and enjoyed with no worries of studies. But it was long back when I was in class 4th .
                    If she reads this blog, I am sure she will cry before reaching the end ... Well thats not life ...!!! Life is to go on ... Whether we are together or apart life goes on and bond of friendship never breaks.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Turning Point -- Lost my Father</i></h2>
                Everthing was going on fine .. My studies were also going on good .. It was morning 16 July,2004 when I woke up early to prepare for tests . It was my test that was scheduled for the day. My father also woke and was happy to see me focussing on studies. He just waved a hand on my head and went to his room. I went to the school, but who knew I was meeting him the last time. It was 4 hours later when I heard that my father had expired... But did I really know what had happened ????? ..... ???? The answer is "No".... !!! I did not knew the meaning of "Death" that time. I went to play Tekken the same day in the evening with my big brother. U must be thinking that it was foolish act .... but i didnot really didnt know what to do !!! 
                The impact of my father's death just made me weak. The most profound ability of mine is I can tolerate pain to a  great level without letting others know. It was to this fact that my eyes became weak. I even cried at times alone but Since I didn't want to show to others kept to myself. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"><i>My Aim --- Losing Friendship</i></h2>
                <p>
                    It was after 1 year when I began studying very hard to acheive my Father's dream of becoming doctor.At present I am not able to fulfill his dream but she is becoming doctor....Although , if he was alive, He would be happy to see me growing fast, not just technically but also philosphically. My love for poors, my skills, and other stuffs. 

                    It seems weird of  not talking of my mother till now ... Lady behind my success.. 
                    At times people will call her cruel since she always wanted me to study ... But it was her time she devoted to me, which most of the mothers dont do at present. Even if she dont understand what i am studying she used to sit to see if i am studying or just reading comics.
                    Sometimes my mother's relatives(including her mother) used to say to stop bothering about Amir.. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we grew, our friendship got little disturbed with the fact that we didnt get time to meet or talk,even in family gatherings and functions. I was becoming a sort of nerd preparing for Boards/Engineering etc...
                </p>
                 <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Lost in books</i></h2>
                 <p>
                    Its my request not to judge characters till u have reached the end.....
                    I sort of got lost in books and also some family matters.. Marriges of my brothers and sisters were one of them.
                    The engagement breakup of my sister was the most heart breaking for me ... I learned one thing from that time onwards .. "Even If dont get job, I wont break anyone's heart." I also learned a fact that money cant buy hapiness.
                    While u must be thinking that I am in Saudi Arabia only for earning money !!!! This is most people think ... !! 
                    Do hell with those people.... I am here bcoz I had to be... not discusing further...
                    I also joined coaching in Class X1 for IIT and it went on for 2 years...
                 </p>
                 <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Her mother ill ... A friend in need is a friend indeed</i></h2>
                 <p> 
                    It was my 12th Boards, alongwith her sister marriage, but her mother got seriously ill. She also had exams at one end and mother ill at the other and marriage at the end. But what she woried was about her mother... I knew this feeling since I had already lost my father and knew how it feels. It was Maanjha Ceremony as i remember when her mother was admitted. On hearing this , she just lost herself .... I couldnt control myself from standing close to her and told that everything would be fine ....But she was also worried about her exams ... This is what the world is today. Being her best friend(as to what I think.. dont know about her).. I just convinced her that I will teach all the stuffs for her exams.(My exams were also there and by Allah Grace I always did preparation in advance). I dont like to study one night before exams.
                     When the function was almost over, i had almost forgotten my promise of teaching which I made few hours before.She came to me for help... I really dont know how to  say 'No' .. And that to for my best friend and when she is in need .. So I didnt care of realtives(who just mock u and cant keep mouth shut). I just sat beside her, took a book and taught her some basic concepts and important questions and then left.
                    The next day, she said thanks and we discussed the papers.    
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Delhi--- Jamia Millia Islamia</i></h2>
                  <p>
                    I got Selected in Jamia Computer Science Departments.It was next eight-nine months we didnt talk at all. Only in Eid , I took her mobile number from my cousin's phone(Again it was me trying to continue friendship). I thought that she would not respond to me since she had many other friends then. <i>My cousin Shuggu was her new best friend since he was teaching him physics </i>. 
                    But then We got into touch with Whatsapp.
                    We also got into nimbuzz  and talked.
                  </p>
                   <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Random Thoughts --- Random Talks</i></h2>
                   <p>
                    While sometime she said that I abandoned our friendship for  years until i made my future safe .. But saying this is totally wrong... Although my  main aim then was to become a good engineer but not by abandoning a good friend..
                    We talked almost daily about weirdest things of dinner,sleep, dreams, study... etc .. 
                    This way i spent 4 years . We met rarely at functions or festivals and seldom talked.
                   </p>
                   <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Present ---- Complex </i></h2>
                   <p>
                        Well, stuck here in Saudi Arabia ,She doesnot reply often to my messages... She even calls me "Darpok" and "Bade Log". Sometimes I feel she doesn't know me at all ... Maybe she is bored with her nerd friend and not getting reply from his best friend, He lies on the bed every night hoping for reply .. but work is making her busy .. maybe time for our friendship to part .. But There are miles to go.......She thinks that I am a big man now... But who can say I am still the same Amir who is just baffling the life and preventing  himself from falling down. My mother's expectations for me to take place of my father's position. But I dont want to become rich. I just hate being famous.. I want to live a simple life and thats the reason I have joined Government Job(symbol of Peace). But People think that I need Money..... 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last line of mine is just that she will remain my only best friend whom I trust more than anyone else in the world. This is my story and most probably her(although she has lot many friends now.... so easy for her to forget me). 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has been 5 hours since I am writing continously.. Only drank Pepsi in between...Going to sleep...
                    </p>
