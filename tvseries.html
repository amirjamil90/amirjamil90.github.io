                <h2 class="section-heading"> The Originals </h2>
                <p>
                The most addicting TV Series I have ever watched. Even now I m eagerly waiting for Season 4 for the Original...
                Family is most Important !!!!  
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading"> The Prison Break </h2>
                <p>
                Although I watched it quite late, but the way Season 1 has been potrayed, u  cant just relax without finishing all the episodes.
                I watched the first season in 4 days....
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Homeland</h2>
                    It was acting of Damian Lewis and Claire Danes that encouraged me to watch the first 2 seasons. But it went to be bored after the second season.
                    The performance from Damian Lewis was awesome and suspense was maintained till 2nd end of second season.
                </p>
                     <p> <h2 class="section-heading">Mr. Robot</h2>

                       Owing to Interest in Hacking,  I liked the stuffs in first season but have not been able to watch 2nd season till now.
                                               
                     </p>
                    <p><h2 class="section-heading">Silicon Valley</h2>
                    The first Season was just fantastic ... The Disrupt Conference at the end of the season was mindoblowing but i didnot like the second season.
                    </p>
                     <h2 class="section-heading">The Vampire Diaries</h2>
                     <p>
                     I watched it during College owing to Adeel. Acting of Daemon was just awesome...Left it in Season 4 when I found it boring ......
                     </p>
                     <p><h2 class="section-heading">The Game Of Thrones </h2>
                     While some will be wondering why i haven't mentioned GOT till now... Its just bcoz i didn't like it at first attempt.. It was just after my Semester Exams when I started to watch the series and watched 2 seasons in 2 days  continous(excluding 6 hrs sleep).
                     </p>
                        <p><h2 class="section-heading"> Sherlock Holmes </h2>
                        The best season was season 1 where I Got to meet Benedict's acting for the first time.
                        All the seasons are worth watching.
                        </p>
