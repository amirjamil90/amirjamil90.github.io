                <h2 class="section-heading">The final semester project</h2>
                <p>
                    Major Project was completed in 3 weeks but we(Ankur and I) were trying to customize the project for a better look for code semantics and performance. We tried number of ways to improve performance... used siege for analysis and tried bit of parallel programming to run a part of code parallel. We got the results for Research paper published for Minor Project "Digial Image Authentication and Encryption using Digital Signature". Our Research got best paper Award at IEEE. Meanwhile I was preparing for End Semester Examinations and doing research on Genetic Algorithm.  Placement Tension was over, by God's grace I was placed in Jabong and TCS in campus. Most of the time went in playing cards, football in the hostel with friends(fahad,ahraf,harsh,obed,chidda,adeel). A company named "Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd" was about to visit the campus. So I googled and asked my seniors about the company. At the first glance, I thought It was not a company I craved for ... but the word PSU before it pushed me to give the  interview. After the interview was over, my desire to enter the PSU also diminished with time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exams were completed and college was over .. Final goodybye to hostel friends and batchmates ... I began to question myself for the kind of life I wanted to live. That was the time when I decided to join Jabong and when to Lucknow to spend few days before my joining.During my stay at Lucknow, I got interest in Network Programming and implemented few CGI scripts in LUA. It was 7th June,2015  I joined Jabong...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Jabong ... the ecommerce bloom...</h2>
                    It was good to see that some of my batchmates have also joined(Afsha,Shreyansh,Shamim,Utsav,Zeba). All the joining formalities was done and we were introduced to Jabong Culture of Working. Apart from Jamia, students from other colleges also joined Jabong. We were total of 22 freshers employed in Jabong.On the second day, We had lunch with Mr.Praveen Sinha, Cofounder and CEO of Jabong.We got a training for 7 days for Jabong working and the departments with their respective heads. We were encorporated in different departments in the technology Sector. I was  in the FrontEnd Development team. The Frontend team was lead by Upendra Dev ,one of the best Managers I have ever worked with... The project was titled "Reincarnation" which was shifting the frontend to Node platform. Initially I was given time to get hands on with Javascript ....Since I knew it from before , It took me 10 days to get integrated with the platfrom they were working(Sails js).
                    At first I was assigned small bugs that I needed to fix .. I took interest and fixed the bugs taking more time than the bug required. My Manager gave me an assignment to make a "Task handling and Management Tool" for daily scrum using Mongo and Node. I made initial with mongo and node,but then it wasnt not great at frontside . So switched to use bootstrap theme.All though he appreciated but did not use my product.
                    To give a more drastic turn to Reincarnation project , We decided to move on to object oriented design and tried to convert the written javascript into TypeScript with Object Oriented Paradigm. But since ran out of time we dropped tha approach for future to launch the reincarnation. 
                    Two months passed in this way... </p>
                     <p>
                     Cancel Order Page Implementation was given and we(Rajesh + I) did a Test Driven Development for that Page.Some issues came while integrating it with main platform, but finally we released the product in one month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I was then transferred on to work on Catalog Page where I met Ravinder Singh Rawat.. One of the best minds in Jabong. We tried to reduce the regression of Catalog Page. In the mean time, we build a complete regression test suit case with NightWatch.js. 
                     </p>
                     <h2 class="section-heading">TCIL.. the forgotten interview ....</h2>
                     <p>
                     Everything was going fine, until one night I recieved a mail from Deepak Sain from TCIL mentioning that I got Selected in TCIL. the company I had forgotten again came into existence ..I googled about company .. pros and cons ... discussed with family members, friends , office employees etc . Some said private is better while others told pros of Government Sector. At last, I gave resignation in Jabong ....to join a PSU ..<br>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Well, it was my first day in TCIL .. I reached 1 hour before inorder to be on time knowing about Delhi's traffic...I realizeed the work culture drift ... from Toursers and stylish tshirts to formal shirts and pants .... I got to make many friends in 2 to 3 days of joining . I heard people telling that TCIL is not a good company while some told that we will be transferred to Africa .. Well hearing this, I told my brother to arrange 1.50lacs for bond money .... But then, We were sent to Ghaziabad for training in ALTTC. Those 15 days spent there felt good .. apart from tensions and with friends.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     A setback to me was when I got transferred to Project in Kingdom OF Saudi Arabia..
                     It was Feb 25,2016 when I landed in Saudi Arabia..At first look I saw the speed of cars in Saudi Arabia..120km/hr was normal speed ... Five trainees were identified for the KSA Project(Abdul,ashish,manish,narendra and me), but we(abdul and me) were the first one to to be sent to the project.Initially we were appointed in OSP-STC department. I was disturbed with the fact that there was lot of work ... even in the night hours.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Once in a while I thought that my programming career was over... but I kept on doing stuffs whenever I got time.... Months passed in this way .. We were joined by Manish and Ashish , who also were kept in the same project. I remember Manish being distressed from the scorching heat of sun...I was mostly occupied in night hours and slept whole day..We(abdul and me) along with our Deputy Manager(Rashid and Azhar) went for Umrah. It was our first time both of us were not allowed legally to travel outside Riyadh beacuse of Iqama(resident identity) issue. Neverthless we went ... First we went to Medinah... Quiet and Peaceful city ...performed Ziyarat and then headed towards Mecca. The roads from Medinah to Mecca has a beautiful landscape adding to its aesthetic value. We performed the Umrah rituals and came back.. But will always remember since this was my  <i>First Umrah....</i>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     It was then Narendra Bairva joined ... With him came The UPSC drift..He always aspired for UPSC exams and started his preparations from September 2016... 
                     </p>
                     <p> I was not interested at first , but when Geography as a subject was being debated ... I regained my potentials in my childhood subject... .It was then I went on semi-annual vacation to Delhi.. </p>
