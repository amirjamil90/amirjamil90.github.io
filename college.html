                Walking through the Hostel gate at night, shivering in cold with dewdrops falling on head covered with sweat-shirt cap, We(baba,chidda, and me) decided to visit the Pink City . At first it was a difficult decision since our third-eyed man(aman) was not  ready to visit the place who was followed by Chor(shahid). But, owing the urge to visit some place, we decided a vacation plan. It was 10th December 2013, when I booked the tickets for all of them to make sure that the plan wasn’t  cancelled …. The ticket was booked for the next month…. Baccha not introduced till now … remained mystery till the last date…. We also abused Shahid who cancelled the plan around 24th  December, obeying his father’s command…

                        Winter was at its peak around 4th January with trains running late…….some second thoughts came but sticking hard to decisions we went for the vacations. The day was near and preparations were clear… few clothes along with some penny were packed…..
                We waited for Abdullah(ohhh its his real name) at Jamia Bus Stand  who would be accompanied by Aman. We reached at 14:00 hours, and train was also on time ……  Someone has rightly said, “There is always a photogenic person in a group” ……. We also had… We call him Chidda(amir ahmad oohh its his real name)… Some photographs were taken on the station amidst the crowd ……. One is shown as below

                <p>
                    The train journey was just awesome with pleasant afternoon weather and few scenic beauties of the landscape.... We were heading towards Sawai Madhopur.. land of tigers....It was in no time that the dusk was accompanied by moonlight ... At around 20:30 hours We reached our Destined  Station...
